## ✨ Overview

An online store for computer hardware where customers browse components, manage a cart and pay online with **QiCard**, the Iraqi card payment gateway. It includes a full admin dashboard for products and categories.

The app uses the **Next.js App Router** with **React Server Components** and **Server Actions**, so the storefront needs no separate REST layer. Prisma provides end-to-end typed data access, and Zod validates every mutation before it reaches the database.

## 🧩 Features

**Customer**
- 🛍️ Product catalog with search, category filters and a featured carousel
- 🛒 Server-side cart; totals are **always recomputed on the server**
- ❤️ Favorites, ⭐ reviews and ratings
- 💳 Online checkout with **QiCard** and a payment result page
- 📦 Order history with payment status
- 🌗 Dark and light themes, fully responsive UI

**Admin dashboard** (`/admin`)
- Products CRUD with image upload (Supabase Storage)
- Categories CRUD with images
- Orders overview

## 🏗️ Architecture

  U[Browser] -->|RSC + Server Actions| N[Next.js App Router]
  N -->|proxy.ts| C[Clerk Auth]
  N -->|Prisma| DB[(PostgreSQL)]
  N -->|Images| ST[Supabase Storage]
  N -->|Create payment / inquiry| PG[QiCard]
  PG -->|Callback + webhook| N
```

**Payment flow (the server decides):**
1. The server computes the order total from the cart in the database. The client never supplies it.
2. QiCard returns a hosted payment page where the user pays.
3. On callback or webhook, the server makes a **server-to-server status inquiry** and settles the order in a **Serializable transaction**. Settlement is idempotent, so an order can never be marked paid twice.
4. The confirmed amount must match the stored amount. Otherwise the payment is flagged `AMOUNT_MISMATCH`.

## 🔐 Security

Security was designed in from the start:

| Area | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | `/admin` is guarded in `proxy.ts`, and every admin Server Action checks again (defense in depth) |
| Authorization | All admin mutations call `getAdminUser()`. Cart, favorites and orders are always scoped to the session user (no IDOR) |
| Input validation | Zod schemas for products, reviews, images and cart quantities (integer, 1–100), which blocks negative-price manipulation |
| Payments | The webhook body is untrusted input: status and amount are re-verified with QiCard server-to-server, with an optional RSA signature check. Settlement runs in a Serializable transaction |
| File uploads | Images only, 1 MB cap, sanitized storage keys. Old images are looked up in the database, never taken from client input |
| Spoofing | Review author name and avatar come from the session, not the form |
| HTTP headers | HSTS, `X-Frame-Options`, `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`; `X-Powered-By` removed |

> Secrets are stored only in environment variables. `.env*` is git-ignored, and `.env.example` contains placeholders only.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env        # fill in the values

# 3. Database
npx prisma migrate deploy   # or: npx prisma db push

# 4. Run
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:3000
```

## ☁️ Deployment

Deployed on **Vercel**. Add the variables from `.env.example` under *Project → Settings → Environment Variables*, then push. Vercel builds and deploys automatically.

Set `WEBSITE_URL` to your HTTPS production URL so QiCard can reach the callback and webhook.
